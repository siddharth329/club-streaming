### Developer Guide
---
In the project directory, you can run

### `npm install`

This will install all the dependencies required for the project to run.

<br/>

Now after installing all the dependencies, you can start the server with two ways:

* ### `npm run dev`
  This will start the server in development mode with nodemon and will be available on localhost at default port 5000 or the port set in the `.env` file

* ### `npm start`
  This will start the server in production mode. All the environment variable must be changed every time the changes are done in the code for security purposes.
